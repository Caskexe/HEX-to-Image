This is a simple HTML-based tool (with Javascript) that allows you to input a colour hex code and export it as a PNG image. You can also set the dimensions of the image and choose a prefix name for the exported file (for example "Black" will output the file "Black_000000.png"

## Features

- **Hex Code Input:** Enter any valid hex colour code (e.g., `#FF5733`, `#000000`) to generate a PNG image of that colour.
- **Dimensions:** Specify the width and height of the output image.
- **File Name Prefix:** Set a custom prefix for the image file name, making it easier to organise your colours/images.
